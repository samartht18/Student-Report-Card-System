# Student-Report-Card-System
Student Report Card System is a console application developed using Cpp and Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
I utilized VS Code as my integrated development environment for this project.
The main objective of the project was to create a program that could effectively manage student records and their subject marks. 
The system offers various functionalities such as storing, retrieving, displaying, inserting, deleting, and modifying a student's marks in different subjects.
